## Project Name: Spotify Stats / Playlist 

#### Check In: 2

#### Project Pitch:
I want to create an application that displays a users listening habits for short term, medium term and long term intervals. I would like to extend this application to also allow a user to recieve email updates about their listening habits, create playlists based on their top artists and compare against friend's listening habits. 

### Deliverables
Implement redux
Dummy data for design
Login flow w/ spotify (firebase is not necessarily needed)
Progress UI

#### Stack:
React, Router, Redux

#### APIs:

#### Order Of Attack
Iteration 1: Pull in user playlist data, display top artists, and top songs for short, medium and long term. Explore other api endpoints. 
Iteration 2: Email newsletter to update users on their recent listening habits. 
Iteration 3: User is able to post playlists to their spotify profile. 
Iteration 4: Users can compare their listening habits to their Facebook friends. 

#### MVP
Iteration 1 - User can explore their listening habits on a well designed, accessible application.

OAuth
Facebook api
Email newsletter
